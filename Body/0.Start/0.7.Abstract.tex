\Abstract{
\emph{When writing an abstract, bare in mind an abstract is a short descriptive summary of your thesis. The number of words accepted might vary e.g. $200-250$ words. An MS thesis abstract need not exceed two pages. Abstracts are typically written last although they are the most important part of the thesis. They should have a little bit of everything: the background, the scope of your project, the purpose, findings and conclusions. An abstract is neither paragraphed nor cited. It should not be written as a literature review or a discussion of results. In a simplistic manner, your abstract, in a few words, should answer the questions: why should one care about your research; how did you get your results; what did you learn, find, create, invent; and finally what do your results imply?}
